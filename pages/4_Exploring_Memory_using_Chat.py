"""
Most people's first experience with Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI is often through chat interfaces like 
ChatGPT. But what makes chat special? Is it because we can pretend to talk to an AI as if it were a person, 
leading to fears of a Skynet scenario?

I suggest that what makes chat special is that it provides a simple way to access something important to computers: 
memory. When we stop thinking of chat as a conversation with the AI and instead as a data storage tool, we can do 
a lot more with our prompts. 
The possibilities expand greatly, and we can use chat to tap into the full potential of LLMs and generative AI. 
"""

with st.expander("Chat vs. Completion"):
    """
So far, you have seen completion interface. In this exercise, you what use a chat interface. In the context of 
generative AI, the terms "chat" and "completion" refer to different modes of interaction and usage.

Chat: Chat-based models are designed to simulate conversational agents. 
They are trained to understand and generate human-like responses in a conversational manner. 
These models are often used in chatbots or virtual assistants to engage in interactive and dynamic conversations 
with users. Chat models take into account the context of previous messages and generate responses accordingly, 
aiming to maintain coherence and relevance throughout the conversation.

Completion: Completion-based models, on the other hand, focus on generating coherent and contextually relevant text 
based on a given prompt or input. Instead of simulating a conversation, these models aim to extend or complete a 
piece of text based on the provided context. They are commonly used for tasks like language translation, 
summarization, creative writing, or generating responses for single-turn interactions.

While both chat and completion models generate text, the main distinction lies in the intended usage and the 
nature of the interaction. Chat models prioritize maintaining a conversation flow, taking into account the context of 
previous messages, while completion models focus on generating relevant and coherent text based on a specific input 
or prompt.

Let's test the assistant's memory by asking it anything else (for example 
`I am having bread and butter for breakfast today.`) and then check whether it still remembers your name. If it's not 
clear from the initial response whether the assistant still remembers Bob, ask it directly 
(for example, `What is my name?`).

As mentioned, we will make better use of the chat interface if we think of it less as a conversation with a 
computer, and more as a data store. This example sets this out.

When attending hearings or meetings, many lawyers stick to pen or paper, or use some word processing software or 
note-taking software to take down notes.
 _Chat_ applications don't look like they should be used for note taking. (They are conversations, right?) 
However, when combined with a large language model, you can find new and surprising uses.

inputting more lines since I have to wait for ChatGPT to finish.

You can remove this setting (by deleting that line) and running the conversation again.

What do you think of that? It appears that ChatGPT had a pretty good understanding of what you have taken down.

As for the object of our exercise, you will notice that ChatGPT was able to use information from the very first
message, such as the place and the respective roles of the cast, to create the summary right at the very end. In fact,
ChatGPT was using all the information in its possession for all your queries, so your notes can be as unintelligible
as possible, and there's a good chance ChatGPT can make sense out of it.
"""

st.subheader("Exercise 4-3: What's your role in the conversation?")

"""
Using chat as an interface also has another advantage over prompts or a completion interface. It's possible to 
assign different roles to a speaker, so that the context or instructions in a prompt can be treated differently.

Again, because this isn't actually a chat where people are trying to talk to each other, it might not be obvious why 
this is an advantage. (In our previous exercise, there were several characters interacting, and ChatGPT did fine.)

ChatGPT's API (this is not accessible through the usual chat interface) introduces a third role besides the AI and the
user: "system". Using that role, you can guide the assistant into producing more reliable. (If you need an analogy,
the "system" role is like the narrator of the conversation.

Now let's put that system role into practice. In the exercise area below, you can see the system instruction in the 
chat already. Now try to take notes of a mediation session (if you need ideas, you can use the notes from the 
previous exercise). Do you get the same experience?    
"""

              messages=[
                  {"role": "system", "content": "You are listening to a mediation session. Respond 'OK' to any notes "
                                                "provided by the user. When the mediation session has ended, produce a "
                                                "narrative summary of what happened."}
              ])

"""
By using a "system" role, you were able to replicate the original instructions.

An astute reader might question the point of this, since it look like you are able to instruct the model quite 
comprehensively when a user interacts with an assistant in the first place. However, a role like "system" can tell the 
model or the program more. For example, the model can place more importance on instructions from a system role than 
a user role (you might notice that in the second exercise, the model is more likely to respond with "OK".). Implementing
a moderation function is also more sensible when you can tell which input is from the user.  

In most use cases, since completion is easily replicated by a chat interface, you should use a chat interface whenever
it is available. 
"""

st.header("Conclusion")

"""
In this lesson, we discovered the power of prompt engineering for lawyers using chat interfaces. 
By treating chat as a data storage tool and leveraging the "system" role, we unlocked new possibilities for 
note-taking, generating narrative summaries, and implementing effective instructions. Chat interfaces offer a simple 
yet versatile way to access the full potential of language models and generative AI, making 
them valuable tools for lawyers seeking improved productivity and outcomes.

In the next section, we build on the lessons we learned here to work on something that will open up even more 
opportunities for LLMs: Chains and Agents.
