In a previous section, I declared that ChatGPT is not a lawyer:

>It's important to note that LLMs are not lawyers. As noted above, LLMs generate text based on applying 
> patterns observed in its training data on the prompt given to the LLM. 
> That's not how lawyers find or apply the law. At least theoretically. 

Let's challenge this assumption.

One of the tasks a lawyer is trained to do is to examine the facts, identify the relevant legal principles, 
and consider potential implications.

We will do this by providing the model with a fact pattern, then present it some legal principles, and ask  
for its opinion on whether the provisions applies to a fact pattern.

Before we use any fancy prompt engineering techniques, let's ask ChatGPT directly for the answer (aka "zero shot"). 
We might have detailed prompts about how to perform our tasks, but it's useful to always check our model directly
to see how far we have to go and check how much we have improved our output. 

In the exercise area, I have provided a prompt for the answer we would be exploring in this exercise.

    """
Our international readers may not be familiar with the subject of this problem. Here's a brief introduction.

A Housing Development Board (HDB) flat refers to public housing in Singapore that is developed and managed by the 
Housing and Development Board (HDB), a government statutory board. HDB flats are subsidized, affordable residential 
units intended for Singaporean citizens and permanent residents.
HDB flats are typically high-rise apartment buildings, although there are also some low-rise and walk-up flat designs. 
These flats are sold on a leasehold basis, with lease durations typically ranging from 99 years to 999 years.

HDB flats have played a significant role in Singapore's housing policy, providing affordable and quality housing 
options for its residents. The HDB aims to create sustainable and cohesive communities, fostering social integration 
and promoting homeownership among Singaporeans.

We can laugh about this later, but it isn't useful or "lawyerly" to claim that the answer to a legal question is that
"it depends".

To be fair to ChatGPT,  there's no reason why ChatGPT should give a legal answer when it has no basis to do so.
Let's nudge ChatGPT a bit by providing some legal principles. For this, I have copied a [freely available description
on the law of misrepresentation in Singapore](https://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/About-Singapore-Law/Commercial-Law), 
paragraph 8.10.4 and called it a "Legal Rule". 
It's of general application, so you can imagine that it came from a law textbook.

You would find that ChatGPT produces a very similar reply. If you look closely though, you might find traces of the

I don't like to think of prompting as 'magic words'. As we've shown throughout this course, prompting a model is not

However, if there are truly magic words in this field, "let's think step by step" is probably one of them.

Isn't that a marked improvement? You can see that ChatGPT is now applying the rule to the facts.

the way the training data was formatted?) In any case, this is a useful quick fix if you need to generate an answer
that requires some advanced reasoning.
